                    <p>A reader of Indian Autos Blog managed to capture additional video footage of a convoy of Corvette ZR1 prototypes testing in traffic. We clearly see one hardtop with composite body panels and that absolutely gigantic rear wing, following behind what appears to be a stock Z06. A convertible is third in line, with a midsize wing out back. The fourth Corvette on the highway appears to be another ZR1 convertible, this time with what may or may not be a third wing design – camouflage makes it difficult to tell.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to CorvetteBlogger and photographer David Wesel, we now know that Chevrolet is testing not just a coupe, but also a convertible body for the ZR1. </p>

                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

                    <p>This is a somewhat surprising development, considering the ZR1's position as a pure performance machine – convertibles add weight and lose some stiffness – as well as the original ZR1's hardtop-only body, plus we've only ever seen C7 ZR1 coupes undergoing tests. </p>

                    <p>(Then again, Chevy added a Z06 convertible this time around, so it's fully willing to sell you lots of power with whatever kind of roof you want.) In addition to the convertible revelation, we now see that two types of wings are being tested. One sits a bit lower and is reasonably subtle, while the other flies high and proclaims the car's track-readiness to the world thanks to more surface area and large endplates.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Mitsubishi Montero</h2>

                    <p> sport utility vehicle manufactured by Mitsubishi. It was named after Leopardus pajeros, the Pampas cat, which is native to the Patagonia plateau region of southern Argentina.</p>

                    <p>But pajero in Spanish is also a common term of abuse, usually translated as "wanker" or "tosser", thus perhaps why alternative names have been used for many markets. It is known as the Mitsubishi Montero (meaning "mountain hunter"</p>

                    <blockquote>in the Americas (except Brazil and Jamaica), and Spain, while in the United Kingdom it is known as the Mitsubishi Shogun.</blockquote>

                    <p>Thanks to their success, the Pajero, Montero and Shogun names were also applied to other, mechanically unrelated models, such as the Pajero Mini kei car, the Pajero Junior and Pajero iO/Pinin mini SUVs, and the Mitsubishi Pajero/Montero/Shogun Sport. Main rivals are the Land Rover Discovery, Toyota Land Cruiser Prado SWB/LWB and Nissan Patrol Y61.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Nissan GT-R</h2>

                    <p>The Nissan GT-R is a handbuilt 2-door 2+2 high performance vehicle produced by Nissan unveiled in 2007.[3][4][5] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R although no longer part of the Skyline range itself.

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline sedan called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan  and achieved much fame and success on both road and track. The Nissan GT-R, although no longer carrying the "Skyline" badge, has heritage in the Nissan Skyline GT-R, which was only available in the United States as a grey market car.</span>

                    <p>Similar to the later generations of the Skyline GT-Rs, the Nissan GT-R is four-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 cylinder engine and has the signature four round tail lights. However, the GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with its Skyline siblings and is a complete redesign from previous Skylines rather than an incremental evolution; the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.</p>

                    <p>Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35, or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname Godzilla, given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.</p>
